/**
 * Generate the same model through both of APPWITHAI's command-line interfaces
 * and assert each produced the application it claims to.
 *
 * There are two, and `check-stacks.ts` exercises neither of them. That script
 * drives `language/cli/eml.ts` — this repository's own CLI, which for the
 * `tanstack-nestjs` target loads the generator's orchestrator as a library.
 * The two shipped binaries are a different entry point with their own argument
 * parsing, their own defaults and, in the WASM case, a whole overlay stage
 * after generation:
 *
 *   appwithai       packages/generator/src/cli/generate.ts
 *                   the full stack — NestJS on a PostgreSQL server, TanStack
 *                   Start in front of it, Bun as the runtime.
 *
 *   appwithai-wasm  packages/generator/src/cli-wasm/generate.ts
 *                   the same stack, then an overlay that replaces `pg` with
 *                   WebAssembly PostgreSQL and Bun with Node, so it runs with
 *                   no database server at all.
 *
 * The overlay is why the second is checked rather than assumed: it is the
 * stage where a rename in the generator turns into an application that
 * generates cleanly and then cannot start, and running the first CLI proves
 * nothing about it.
 *
 * `--no-setup` on the full-stack CLI, deliberately. Without it the CLI installs
 * dependencies, migrates and seeds against a PostgreSQL server on 127.0.0.1 —
 * a fine default for someone generating an application to run, and not what
 * this check is asking. What is being checked is that the CLI produces the
 * application; whether a database happens to be listening is a separate
 * question that `check-reporting-pack.ts` answers with a real one.
