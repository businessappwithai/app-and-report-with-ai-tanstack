/**
 * Put a TanStack Start application on a URL sub-path.
 *
 * Both applications here are served from one origin — the generated one under
 * `/app`, the reporting one under `/report` — and neither was written to live
 * anywhere but the root of a host. Three things have to agree for that to work,
 * and getting one of them wrong produces a blank page rather than an error:
 *
 *   1. the bundler's `base`, so the HTML asks for `/report/assets/x.js` rather
 *      than `/assets/x.js`
 *   2. the router's `basepath`, so a client-side link is built as
 *      `/report/dashboard` and an incoming `/report/dashboard` still matches
 *      the `/dashboard` route
 *   3. any hand-written static-file server in front of the app, which maps a
 *      URL path to a file on disk and will not find `assets/x.js` under a
 *      directory it was told is `/report/assets/x.js`
 *
 * The prefix is deliberately *not* stripped by the proxy in front. Stripping it
 * would satisfy (3) for free and then break (2): the server would receive
 * `/dashboard` while every link the router writes says `/report/dashboard`.
 *
 * Applied to a *copy*: the generated application's output, which this project
 * owns, and the reporting application's source inside its image at build time.
 * Neither checked-in project is modified.
 *
 *   bun build/subpath-overlay.ts --dir <appRoot> --base /report
 *
 * Idempotent — a second run over an already-patched tree changes nothing and
 * says so, because the image build and the local generate both run it.

  // That version of TanStack Start is Vinxi-based: it writes the client bundle
  // to `public/_build/` and the rest to `public/assets/`, and serves `public/`
  // at the server root through Nitro. Setting Vite's `base` rewrote *some*
  // emitted URLs and moved no files and did not touch the `_build` router at
  // all, so a build came out half-prefixed:
  //
  //   /app/assets/globals-*.css   200, and `text/html` — the SPA fallback,
  //                               because nothing is on disk at that path
  //   /_build/assets/client-*.js  emitted un-prefixed, 404 behind the proxy
  //
  // A stylesheet request answered with a page is worse than a 404: the browser
  // reports nothing and the application renders unstyled and inert. So this
  // application keeps its root-absolute asset URLs and the proxy in front routes
  // those namespaces to it — see common/docker/nginx/default.conf. The router
  // basepath below is the half that does work, and is what makes every *link*
  // the application writes carry the prefix.

 *
 * This is the step that only running the two applications together revealed,

 *
 * Vite's `base` rewrites asset URLs. The router's `basepath` rewrites links and
 * route matching. Neither touches a request URL written as a string literal in
 * source — and both applications here call their API that way, root-absolute:
 * 174 call sites in the reporting application, 7 in the generated one. Served
 * side by side they both ask for `/api/...` on the same origin, and no proxy
 * can send one path to two upstreams.
 *
 * So the application that *can* be moved is moved. Only client call sites are
 * touched; `createFileRoute("/api/…")` route definitions are left exactly as
 * they are, because the router already prefixes those with its basepath when it
 * matches a request. Rewriting them too would double the prefix.
 *
 * The other application keeps the root, and the proxy routes `/api/` there —
 * see common/docker/nginx/default.conf.

 *     answers 200, then the page navigates itself off the prefix and 404s.

 *     so even reaching the login form by hand ends the same way.
